:py:mod:`exiftool`
==================

.. py:module:: exiftool

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   PyExifTool is a Python library to communicate with an instance of Phil
   Harvey's excellent ExifTool_ command-line application.  The library
   provides the class :py:class:`ExifTool` that runs the command-line
   tool in batch mode and features methods to send commands to that
   program, including methods to extract meta-information from one or
   more image files.  Since ``exiftool`` is run in batch mode, only a
   single instance needs to be launched and can be reused for many
   queries.  This is much more efficient than launching a separate
   process for every single query.
