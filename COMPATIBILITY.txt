PyExifTool does not guarantee source-level compatibility from one release to the next.

That said, efforts will be made to provide well-documented API-level compatibility, 
and if there are major API changes, migration documentation will be provided, when 
possible.

----

v0.1.x - v0.2.0 = smarnach code, API compatible
v0.2.1 - v0.4.5 = code with all PRs, a superset of functionality on Exiftool class
v0.5.0 -        = "should be" API compatible with v0.2.0, but moves functionality added in the versions before to other classes


API changes between v0.2.0 and v0.5.0
	Exiftool constructor, "executable_" parameter renamed to "executable"
